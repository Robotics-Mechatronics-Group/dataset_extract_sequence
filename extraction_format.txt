This is the format to be followed by any .txt that wants to be used as an input for the extract_file.py script.
Each line corresponds to a sequence that can have the same name. The format uses `|` , `:` or ` ` separators depending on the case. 

Each line is:

        output | folder | device1 device2 ... | format1 format2 ... | interaval1 interval2 ...

For the output, if the folder is a subdirectory, the intermediate subdorectories must be created by the user.

The number of devices and formats must be the same.

The format can be:

    * single_file: in case that the data is stored in a data.txt file. The structure of the data inside the file is expected to be:

        <timestamp> <data>...

    * multiple_files: in case that the data is stored in multiple files. The filename of the data is expected to be:

        <device>-<timestamp>.<extension>

Each interval is of type:

    <start>:<end>

The units must be the same as in the data as they are compared.

Using -1 as start or end means that there is no low or up bound.
