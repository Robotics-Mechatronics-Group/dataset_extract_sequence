This is the format to be followed by any .txt that wants to be used as an input for the extract_file.py script.
Each line corresponds to a sequence that can have the same name. The format uses `/` , ` ` or `:` separators and there must be no blank lines. 

Each line is:

        output / folder / device1,device2 ... / format1, format2 ... / interaval 1, interval 2 ...

The number of devices and folders must be the same.

The format can be:

    * single_file: in case that the data is stored in a data.txt file. The structure of the data inside the file is expected to be:

        timestamp data...

    * multiple_files: in case that the data is stored in multiple files. The filename of the data is expected to be:

        seqNumber_timestamp.extension

Each interval is of type:

    start:end

The units must be the same as in the data as they are compared.

Using -1 as start or end means that there is no low or up bound.
